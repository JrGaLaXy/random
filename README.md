## About

Museji was born from the desire to make piano practice more engaging and social. It combines interactive rhythm gameplay with real-time multiplayer, allowing players to play solo, in duets, or in fully customizable rooms with friends.  

We are building Museji as a collaborative project — anyone passionate about Unity, rhythm games, or music apps is welcome to contribute!
