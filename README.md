## About

Museji was born from the desire to make piano practice more engaging and social. It combines interactive rhythm gameplay with real-time multiplayer, allowing players to play solo, in duets, or in fully customizable rooms with friends.  

Museji is a serious, long-term project. We’re looking for developers who want to gain real experience building a full Unity rhythm/piano app and be part of the team from the ground up
